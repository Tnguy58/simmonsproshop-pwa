## [www.SimmonsProShop.com](https://www.simmonsproshop.com)
**Version 2.0.0** 

## Introduction

www.SimmonsProShop.com is a ReactJS progressive web app that I developed for Simmons Bowling Pro Shop. The web app conveys specific and helpful information about the products and services that Simmons Pro Shop provides such as ball drilling, ball baking, etc. I had the task of developing the app from scratch, which entails gathering all of the information that will appear on the app such as the various bowling services, the history of the shop, Q&A, etc., taking all of the pictures that appear on the app and handwriting the descriptions of their bowling services with the guidance of Brian (the owner) and his acquaintances. 

## Information about Simmons Bowling Pro Shop
Simmons Bowling Pro Shop, formerly known as Simmons Sporting Goods, is a bowling pro shop located in North Center, IL. The current owner, Brian Simmons, is the son of the original owner Vern Simmons. Vern founded Simmons Sporting Goods right after the second World War in 1946. Back then Simmons Sporting Goods sold accessories for various sports but they eventually specialized in bowling. Vern's son, Brian, spent a lot of the time at the shop and eventually became great at bowling and he helped his dad run the family shop. In the early 1980's Brian began working full time at the pro shop and has been providing excellent service to the bowling community ever since.

To gain experience building a progressive web app while also learning more about the sport of bowling.
